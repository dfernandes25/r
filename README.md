Most of my coding work is for clients under NDA agreements, but in the spirit of sharing here are some tried and true generic scripts. There are some interesting techniques used, maybe not the most elegant or efficient and that's fine. Optimize until the cows come home. Scripts aren't fully documented, probably not the best guidance for rookies, copy/paste script kiddies, or StackOverflow disciples. Use at your own risk!
